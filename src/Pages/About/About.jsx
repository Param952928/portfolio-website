          Hello, I am Paramjeet Singh. As a highly skilled Full Stack Developer with over
          2.5 years of experience, I specialize in crafting dynamic, scalable, and
          responsive web applications. My expertise lies in HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript, and Node.js, making me proficient in both front-end and
          back-end development.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the front-end, I excel in React.js, a powerful JavaScript library
          that allows for the creation of interactive user interfaces. I am
          adept at designing responsive layouts, managing state and props, and
          seamlessly integrating with APIs and back-end services.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the back-end, my experience with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime
          built on Chrome's V8 engine, allows me to build high-performance,
          scalable applications. I have a strong command of creating RESTful
          APIs using Express.js, a robust web framework for Node.js that
          simplifies the development of server-side applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am also well-versed in MongoDB, a NoSQL database designed for
          handling large volumes of data. My experience with MongoDB includes
          storing and managing data in a flexible, scalable, and secure manner,
          ensuring the integrity and accessibility of application data.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to the core technologies, I am proficient in TypeScript,
          Redux, React Router, MySQL, MongoDB, and various development tools
          such as Visual Studio Code, Git, and Postman. I am also experienced
          with AWS, providing a solid foundation for deploying and managing
          applications in the cloud.
          <br />
          <br />
          Overall, as a Full Stack Developer, I am equipped to handle all
          aspects of web application development, from front-end design to
          back-end architecture and deployment. I am passionate about staying
          up-to-date with the latest trends in web development and continuously
          improving my skills to deliver top-quality software solutions that
          meet the needs of clients and users alike.
